    # * no-autofill - Introspect the datasource but do not automatically generate dimensions or measures
    # * autofill-dimensions-only - Introspect the datasource, automatically generate dimensions only
    # * autofill-measures-only - Introspect the datasource, automatically generate measures only
    # * autofill-all - (default) Introspect the datasource, automatically generate dimensions and measures

    # The list of attribute overrides in case introspection get something wrong
    attributeOverrides:

    # The list of dimensions defined in the UI. The order here will be reflected in the UI
    dimensions:
      # A general dimension looks like so:

      # name: channel
      # ^ the name of the dimension as used in the URL (you should try not to change these)
      #
      # title: The Channel
      # ^ (optional) the human readable title. If not set a title is generated from the 'name'
      #
      # kind: string
      # ^ (optional) the kind of the dimension. Can be 'string', 'time', 'number', or 'boolean'. Defaults to 'string'
      #
      # expression: $channel
      # ^ (optional) the Plywood bucketing expression for this dimension. Defaults to '$name'
      #   if, say, channel was called 'cnl' in the data you would put '$cnl' here
      #   See also the expressions API reference: https://plywood.imply.io/expressions
      #
      # url: string
      # ^ (optional) a url (including protocol) associated with the dimension, with optional token '%s'
      #   that is replaced by the dimension value to generate links specific to each value.

      #
      # title: Average Revenue

      #
      # expression: $main.sum($revenue) / $main.sum($volume) * 10
      # ^ (optional) the Plywood bucketing expression for this dimension.
      #   Usually defaults to '$main.sum($name)' but if the name contains 'min' or 'max' will use that as the aggregate instead of sum.
      #   this is the place to define your fancy formulas
